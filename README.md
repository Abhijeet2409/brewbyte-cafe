## ✨ Developer Note

> I started this project as a fun side-build. The core idea behind this café simulation gradually took shape as I solved JavaScript problems.

> I added animations, async flows, interactivity, and even simulated an entire order system — all using vanilla JS.

> This was also my first serious attempt at responsive design — and while I now realize my approach could be improved, I’m proud of the effort and what I learned.

> From the initial order to the final coffee being served — everything you see is the result of consistent effort, late-night bug hunts, and a lot of passion.

> I hope you enjoy this café experience as much as I enjoyed building it! ☕
