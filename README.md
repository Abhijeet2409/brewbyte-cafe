# ☕ BrewByte Café

Welcome to **BrewByte Café** — A Responsive (Width-Focused), animated coffee ordering experience built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project is a creative simulation of a real café ordering system, complete with background music, animated coffee cups, responsive layout, and a fun interactive design.

- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Scales beautifully from **320px to 1440px** width.

- 💻 **Optimized for Devices** –  While the layout was optimized for a target height of **600px**, some height-specific scenarios may show slight visual quirks — something learned and noted during post-build testing.

- ✨ **Custom Animations** – Hover effects, transitions, and more.

- 🔄 **Dynamic Coffee Orders** – Simulated using Promises and `async/await`.

- 🧭 **Anchor Links** – Mimics navigation to pages like "App Store" or "About".

## ✨ Developer Note

> I started this project as a fun side-build. The core idea behind this café simulation gradually took shape as I solved JavaScript problems.

> I added animations, async flows, interactivity, and even simulated an entire order system — all using vanilla JS.

> This was also my first serious attempt at responsive design — and while I now realize my approach could be improved, I’m proud of the effort and what I learned.

> From the initial order to the final coffee being served — everything you see is the result of consistent effort, late-night bug hunts, and a lot of passion.

> I hope you enjoy this café experience as much as I enjoyed building it! ☕
